You can install this app manually without ToonStore :

 - Open an sftp tool like WinScp/Mozilla on Windows to browse to your Toon.
 - On your Toon go to /qmf/qml/apps and create a folder toonGames.
 - In that folder you put at least the qml files and the drawables folder.
 - Restart the GUI. ( On your Toon go to > Settings > TSC > Restart GUI )
 - After that you can add a tile named 'Toon Games'.
